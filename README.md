Chakravuya Archives is a Library management system built with MySQL, PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, designed to practice CRUD operations.
MySQL is used for efficient data storage and retrieval, while PHP handles backend logic for user interaction and database management.
The design is inspired by Minecraft, featuring pixelated, blocky visuals and textures to create a fun, nostalgic feel.
HTML and CSS define the layout, and JavaScript adds interactivity with real-time search and smooth page transitions.
The system allows admins to manage books (add, update, delete) and enables users to browse and search the library.
The project combines backend functionality with creative Minecraft-inspired design, showcasing both technical skills and visual appeal.
